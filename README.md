# Our Forests Tomorrow: Visualizing European forests future

In February 2022 European researchers published the [Eu-Trees4F study](https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC127314), comprised of a dataset that predicts the extent of 67 tree species in Europe, in 2035, 2065 and 2095, on a 10km grid, according to a whole range of bioclimatic parameters and on two different RCPs (intermediate 4.5 and BAU 8.5).

The amount of considered species, the precision of the simulation and the relatively high spatial resolution makes this dataset an absolute goldmine for forestry, research, biodiversity, but considering how the issue of forests has become salient in the public opinion, this could also be interesting to a really broad audience. Where I live in the West of France, people would be shocked to learn that our beloved beech trees, birch trees, aspens, will be likely gone within 45 years. But with a little help (in the form of assisted migration), the forests here could see new species thrive like Mediterranean oaks, willow trees, etc.

The goal of that project is to bring those findings to a large audience, building interactive product(s) such as a minisite and notebooks, and through media partners.

## What are we up to?

- The mini site prototype: [Our Forests Tomorrow](https://devseed.com/our-forests-tomorrow/build/)
- Based on that initial work, we ran several [technical/design experiments](https://github.com/developmentseed/our-forests-tomorrow/issues/1)
- Work on the way to develop a visual identity as well as high-fidelity designs for a final version of the minisite
- We developed two stories based on the initial study, currently drafted as Observable notebooks:
  - [Jamón ibérico under threat from climate crisis](https://observablehq.com/@nerik/eu-trees4f-jamon-iberico-under-threat-from-climate-crisis)
  - [Positive effects of climate change and warmer conditions for European trees](https://observablehq.com/@nerik/eu-trees4f-positive-effects-of-climate-change-and-warmer-co)
  - see [working document](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/EUTrees-4F-Storytelling--B1xvfzlZQDPKG9WqxC_iDGmmAg-0dzBRWbdXLaLB3DIZZ6lE) (private)
